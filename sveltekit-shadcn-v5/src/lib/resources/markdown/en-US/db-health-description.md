This endpoint (GET /api/health/db) performs a database connectivity check to verify that the application can successfully connect to and query the database. It provides essential validation for database availability and connection health.

#### Local Environment Requirements

**Important**: This feature currently works only in local environments for this template. To use database health checks, you must:

- Have a local database server running (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
- Configure proper database connection settings in your environment
- Ensure database credentials and connection strings are properly set
